This project created with PlatformIO which is a extention of Visual Studio Code. Codes written
in C++ language. To follow the footsteps of creator while creating the project one must select the board as 
"Espressif32 Dev Module" and framework as "Arduino". Project has two source file: main.cpp and main.h. 
The header file includes libraries such as DHT.h and LiquidCrystal.h. These two libraries could be added 
to project through library manager in PlatformIO. Arduino.h is a framework library that comes with a framework
selection. Bluetooth.h is a library within ESP32 MCU. Only including this library is enough to use it.
